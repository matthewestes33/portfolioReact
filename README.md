## Features

When the employer loads the portfolio, a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer is generated.

When the employer views the header, the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio are present. 

When the employer views the navigation titles, "About Me," "Portfolio," "Contact," and "Resume" are present, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted.

When the employer clicks on a navigation title, the corresponding section appears below the navigation without the page reloading, and that title is highlighted.

When the employer views the portfolio the first time, the "About Me" title and section are selected by default. 

The About Me section contains a recent photo or avatar of the developer, and a short bio.

The Portfolio section contains titled images of at least six of the developer’s applications, with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories.

The Contact section contains a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message.

When the employer moves the cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text, a notification appears, informing the employer that the respective field is required.

When the employer enters text into the email address field that does not meet the requirements listed in the helper.js file, a notification appears.

The Resume section contains a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies.

When the employer views the footer, text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub, LinkedIn, and INSERT THIRD HERE profiles are present.
